# Development, configuration, and testing

## Data and configuration

Mixdog uses `~/.mixdog` as its home root and `~/.mixdog/data` for runtime data
by default.

```bash
MIXDOG_HOME=/path/to/home mixdog
MIXDOG_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data mixdog
```

Useful environment variables:

- `MIXDOG_TUI_MOUSE=0` — use terminal-native mouse behavior.
- `MIXDOG_DISABLE_MODEL_PREFETCH=1` — disable provider model prefetch.
- `MIXDOG_MODE=ship|dev` — select shipping or development diagnostics.
- `MIXDOG_DIAGNOSTICS=1` — force diagnostic trace and log output.

## Core technology

| Layer | Stack |
| --- | --- |
| Shared agent runtime | Node.js and ECMAScript modules, shared by CLI and Desktop |
| Terminal UI | React and Ink |
| Desktop workspace | Electron, React, TypeScript, Monaco, and xterm.js |
| Native code tools | Rust, tree-sitter, and embedded ast-grep for parsing, structural queries, and rule-based checks |
| Browser automation | Chromium and the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) |
| Long-term memory | Managed local PostgreSQL with pgvector and full-text search |
| Documents | Portable OOXML and PDF tooling, plus Microsoft Office automation on Windows |

These components serve different roles: native tools analyze code, database
retrieval keeps historical context selective, and provider-specific caching
reduces repeated model processing. See [Context efficiency](context-efficiency.md)
for how they work with prompt management and compaction.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start

npm run smoke
npm run smoke:all
npm test                       # discovered fast-lane tests
npm test -- src/runtime/memory  # narrow to one path
npm run test:slow              # *.slow.test.mjs
npm run test:live              # built-artifact or live-system checks
npm run build:tui
npm run audit:models
```

For desktop development, install the root dependencies above, then:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

Desktop development runs in an isolated dev profile, including its own data,
daemon and tool connections. It never reads or changes the installed app's
settings, sign-ins or sessions. `npm run dev` keeps one profile
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\mixdog-dev\default` on Windows, `~/.mixdog-dev/default`
elsewhere), so settings, sign-ins and sessions made in the dev app survive
restarts; select another kept profile with `npm run dev -- --profile <name>`.
`npm run dev:fresh` starts from an empty throwaway profile, retained in the
system temporary directory for diagnosis. CDP uses port `9342`; if it is
occupied, reuse the running dev app or choose another port with
`npm run dev -- --port 9343`.
On Windows, `npm run e2e:direct` and `npm run e2e:direct:source` also use isolated
profiles and port `9342` (override with `-- -Port 9343`).

Both packages discover `*.test.mjs` and `*-test.mjs` under their `src/` and
`scripts/` directories. Fast, slow, and live tests run in separate lanes;
live checks need their corresponding built artifacts or services. See
[testing practices](testing.md) for details.

Main directories:

```text
src/            CLI, TUI, runtime, workflows, agents, and rules
apps/desktop/   desktop app
apps/relay/     remote web app and relay
native/         native process, search, graph, patch, and support binaries
scripts/        tests, diagnostics, benchmarks, and build scripts
benchmarks/     reproducible benchmark harnesses, results, and raw artifacts
src/vendor/     vendored runtime components
```

## Models and composer commands

For a custom provider, leave the manual model list empty to discover models
automatically. Adding manual model IDs restricts the catalog to those IDs and
skips automatic discovery. Per-model visibility and reasoning overrides still
apply; removing all manual IDs enables discovery again.

In the desktop `/model` picker, use the star beside a model to add or remove it
from **Favorites**, above **Recent** and the provider groups. Favorites are saved
on this device, separately for each provider and model, and follow the picker’s
search filter. Disconnected models disappear from the section until available
again without losing their saved favorite.

The desktop composer executes recognized slash commands such as `/model`.
Other leading-slash text, including absolute paths, is sent as ordinary text.
An untouched autocomplete suggestion must not replace that text on Enter;
choose a suggestion explicitly with the palette controls when wanted.

## macOS signing and notarization

Release builds sign the macOS app with a Developer ID certificate and notarize
it when all five repository secrets below are set. With none of them the app is
packaged unsigned; a partial set fails the macOS job rather than shipping a
signed but un-notarized app.

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64` | Base64 of the exported Developer ID Application `.p12` |
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password of that `.p12` |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_P8` | Contents of the App Store Connect API key (`AuthKey_*.p8`) |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` | Key ID of that API key |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER` | Issuer ID of the App Store Connect team |

The hardened-runtime entitlements live in
`apps/desktop/build/entitlements.mac.plist`.
